# HBSsNN
Recurrent Neural Networks for Heartbeat Stars Recognition

The model directory contains 2 pre-trained RNNs.

The sample directory includes 4 test datasets.

Run results.py to generate test result plots directly.

The neural network architecture is defined in rnn.py

The derive_forb_Kepler.py and derive_forb_TESS.py programs are used to derive orbital frequencies for Kepler and TESS data, respectively.

The fnpeaks directory contains the source code for performing the Fourier transform. To build it, run the make command.
